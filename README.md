# Ethereum Tax Dodgeball

Tag friends or strangers with tax liability with or without their knowledge.

Only U.S. taxpayers may be tagged, but anyone in the world can tag a U.S. taxpayer.

See the IRS guidance on this process [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-19-24.pdf).

## Usage

Call the following functions:

```solidity

```

To withdraw your investment, call the `withdraw` function:

```solidity
contract.withdraw();
```

### Opt Out

An opt-out function is available for taxpayers who do not wish to participate.  Simply send the required opt-out fee to the `optOut` function to be excluded from future airdrops.

## Development

To compile and test:

```bash
npm run compile
npm run test
```
